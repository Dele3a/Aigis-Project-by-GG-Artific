# 🏗️ Aigis – AI for Structural Pathology Detection

Aigis is an **AI-powered Flutter app** that helps engineers and inspectors detect and analyze **structural pathologies** in buildings and infrastructure.  
By combining **computer vision** with a clean mobile interface, Aigis makes it faster and easier to identify cracks, corrosion, and other defects that affect structural safety.

## ✨ Features
- 📸 **Image Analysis** – Upload or capture photos of structures for AI-powered detection  
- 🏚️ **Pathology Detection** – Identify cracks, spalling, corrosion, and more  
- 🧾 **Instant Reports** – Get quick insights into defect type and severity  
- 💬 **AI Chat Assistant** – Ask technical questions and get real-time guidance  
- 📱 **Cross-platform** – Works on Android & iOS   

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)  
- **AI Models:** TensorFlow Lite / PyTorch Mobile  
- **Backend & Storage:** Firebase   

## 🚀 Roadmap
