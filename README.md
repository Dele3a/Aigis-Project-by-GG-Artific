## 📖 Project Overview
Infrastructure safety is one of the most critical challenges in modern engineering. Traditional inspection methods are often:
- **Time-consuming**
- **Expensive**
- **Subjective**, relying heavily on human expertise.

Aigis aims to **redefine structural assessment** by combining:
- **Computer Vision** (AI-driven defect detection)  
- **Civil Engineering knowledge**  
- **User-friendly mobile technology**  

This fusion allows **faster, smarter, and more reliable inspections**, ultimately helping engineers maintain safer cities and more resilient infrastructure.
